**Libraries vs Frameworks vs SwiftPackage vs Modules, which one is better and how you can work with those in Apple universe.**

Learn how to build an iOS framework, which lets you share code between apps, modularise your code or distribute it as a third-party library.
You could also organise your code into different packages locally to increase maintainability and reusability of your code.

### What to expect
In this workshop/talk we will work on a sample project and follow this list together:

<ul>
    <li>Libraries vs Frameworks vs SwiftPackage vs Modules</li>
    <li>Create a new framework for an existing project</li>
    <li>Migrate different codes and classes to the framework.</li>
    <li>Import everything back into the app.</li>
    <li>Pack it as a Swift Package.</li>
    <li>Use your package using Swift Package Manager.</li>
    <li>Build a binary framework, XCFramework.</li>
    <li>Document your package using DocC</li>
</ul>
  

### What you will take home

By the end of this talk/workshop, when you are developing an app you know how to structure your code better or how to migrate your legacy code into a package. It will also allow you to document your code better and distribute it through Github pages. 
After all you can decide when/how you can work with Libraries vs Frameworks vs SwiftPackage vs Modules.

### Technical Requirements

The attendees need to have a basic understanding of developing iOS apps. They donâ€™t need to be experts, however there will be some advanced code snippet in there as well.
