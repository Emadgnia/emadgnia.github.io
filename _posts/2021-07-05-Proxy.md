Using Swift 5, iOS 14, Xcode 12

Charles Proxy offers developers and testers an immediate look at network traffic. But there's a lot to learn beyond the basics.

If you've ever wanted to change response data without asking the back-end server to test the client, report a server-side bug or reproduce a state on the client that needs a specific back-end response, advanced Charles Proxy features offer solutions.

### In this tutorial

You'll manipulate the response from the **Star Wars API (SWAPI)** to your own custom API in the **StarCharles** app. Along the way, you'll:

<ul>
  <li>Set up Charles.</li>
  <li>Use the <em>mapping tool</em> and <em>breakpoints</em>.</li>
  <li>Perform repetitive actions with the <em>rewrite</em> and <em>repeat</em> tools.</li>
  <li>Save network activity to disk.</li>
  <li>Share reports with others.</li>
</ul>
